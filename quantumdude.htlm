            <h2 class="section-title">Welcome to My World</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Abel, and I'm a 17-year-old from Ethiopia. I'm a Grade 10 student with a deep passion for math and science. This website is a place where I explore the wonders of these subjects and share my curiosity with the world.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">The Beauty of Science</h2>
            <p>Science is not just a collection of facts; it is a way of understanding the universe. It starts with questions like, "Why is the sky blue?" or "How do plants grow?" By observing, experimenting, and thinking critically, science helps us uncover the rules that govern everything around us.</p>
            <p>The quote by Carl Sagan perfectly captures the essence of science: *"Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge."* It teaches us to approach the world with curiosity and skepticism, to ask questions, and to seek evidence for the answers.</p>
            <p>From the tiniest particles to the vastness of space, science is our tool to unlock the secrets of the universe. It’s about discovery, creativity, and the pursuit of truth.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">The Power of Mathematics</h2>
            <p>Mathematics is the language of the universe. It allows us to describe patterns, make predictions, and solve problems. Whether it's calculating the trajectory of a rocket or understanding the spread of diseases, math is essential to nearly every field of science and technology.</p>
            <p>Math is not just about numbers; it’s about logic and reasoning. It teaches us to think critically, analyze situations, and find solutions. For example, algebra helps us model real-world problems, while geometry shows us the beauty of shapes and symmetry.</p>
            <p>One of the most amazing aspects of math is its universality. The principles of math are the same whether you are in Ethiopia, the United States, or on another planet. It truly connects us all.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Why I Love Science and Math</h2>
            <p>I’ve always been fascinated by how science and math explain the world around us. I love asking questions and finding answers through experimentation and problem-solving. Whether it’s exploring the mysteries of quantum mechanics or understanding the equations of motion, these subjects fuel my curiosity and drive to learn more.</p>
            <p>To me, science and math are not just subjects; they are adventures. They challenge me to think, explore, and imagine what’s possible. My goal is to keep learning, discovering, and sharing my knowledge with others.</p>
